# ONTrust: A Reference Ontology of Trust

ONTrust is a well-founded reference ontology, specified in OntoUML, that formally characterizes the concept of trust, as well as clarifies the relation between trust and risk, and represents how risk emerges from trust relations. The term ROT was previously used to refer to the Reference Ontology of Trust. As of June 2024 it was renamed ONTrust.

## Project Structure

* [/ontouml](/ontouml) contains files related to the conceptual version of ONTrust, which was modelled in OntoUML.
* [/owl](/owl) contains files related to the gUFO-based implementation of ONTrust, represented in OWL.
* [/owl](/owl/previous_version) contains files related to the previous version gUFO-based implementation of the ontology, formerly known as ROT.
