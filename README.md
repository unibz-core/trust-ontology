# ROT: A Reference Ontology of Trust

ROT is a well-founded reference ontology, specified in OntoUML, that formally characterizes the concept of trust, as well as clarifies the relation between trust and risk, and represents how risk emerges from trust relations. 

## Project Structure

* [/ontouml](/ontouml) contains files related to the conceptual version of ROT, which was modelled in OntoUML.
* [/owl](/owl) contains files related to the gUFO-based implementation of ROT, represented in OWL.


## Reusing .vpp files

* To open and edit .vpp files, use [Visual Paradigm] (https://www.visual-paradigm.com)
* To open and edit .ttl files, use [Protégé] (https://protege.stanford.edu/)

## Built With

* [Visual Paradigm] (https://www.visual-paradigm.com) - a free diagramming tool.
* The OntoUML Plugin for Visual Paradigm [https://github.com/OntoUML/ontouml-vp-plugin](https://github.com/OntoUML/ontouml-vp-plugin)
